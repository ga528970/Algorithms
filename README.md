Our program will have a tree diagram that shows the main family tree each person will be numbered. If the user enters the person's name/number it will show who their children are. If they don't have children it will show their parents.

Algorithms
Learning Goals and Success Criteria
I can determine the performance difference between algorithms
I can design and Implement algorithms to solve a problem
I understand when and how to use recursive algorithms
Overview
Algorithms are a list of steps for solving a problem that is well defined, like: finding the shortest path from point A to point B; determining how much each person needs to pay when splitting the bill at a restaurant; finding out how two people are related given a family tree.



We often implement specific algorithms using specific programming languages and target specific hardware platforms but we generally design algorithms independent of hardware or software platforms.
Instructions
This assignment can be completed individually or in groups of two or three.  If working in groups, you must work with someone you haven’t worked with before.

Problem
Given any two members in a family tree display the relationship of the first person to the second person.  Ie. George is the great grandparent of Stephen; or Jackson is the child of Emily.
The family tree to use for this project is modelled here.  Notice that not all parts of the tree are visible until you select specific people.
Design
Using words and/or drawings/diagrams, articulate the design of your algorithm for the solving the problem
Write pseudo code for your algorithm
Implementation
Using any programming language you wish implement your algorithm
The program displays the list of people in the tree in some way
The user shall be asked to select 2 people from the list
The program shows the relationship between the two people selected
Your source code and documentation should be stored in a public repository on GitHub.com (or equivalent)
Add your teacher to the project as a team member
Whenever you are ready to have your code reviewed by the teacher create a pull-request from the “assignment” branch into the “main” branch and assign the pull-request to the teacher
Your teachers will give you feedback using comments in the pull-request
Submit a link to your GitHub repository
Assessment
You will be assessed individually on your level of understanding, creativity and resourcefulness.
